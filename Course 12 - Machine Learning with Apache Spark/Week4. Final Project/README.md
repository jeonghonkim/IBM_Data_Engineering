# Final Project <br/>

## Description <br/>
In this module, you will apply the data engineering skills and techniques you have acquired throughout the course. The course concludes with a final project and assignments that allow you to demonstrate your proficiency in these areas. You will step into the role of a data engineer working at a renowned aeronautics consulting company recognized for its adeptness in handling large datasets. Your role as a data engineer is crucial as the data scientists rely on your expertise to carry out ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks and establish machine learning pipelines. While data scientists possess expertise in machine learning, they depend on your specialized knowledge to handle various algorithms and data formats. Your contribution plays a vital role in ensuring the smooth execution of their tasks. <br/>

## Objectives <br/>
* Extract data from CSV and parquet files.
* Transform the data using Spark dataframes.
* Load the data into data files.
* Create machine learning pipelines.
