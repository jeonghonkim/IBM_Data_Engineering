# Machine Learning with Apache Spark <br/>

## Description <br/>
This module will introduce you to Spark and provide an overview of its key features and applications in the field of data engineering. You will discover the process of connecting to a Spark cluster using SN labs and delve into various topics such as regression, mileage prediction, classification, diabetic classification, clustering, and clustering load data using SparkML. Additionally, you will gain insights into how to construct these models using Spark ML. Moreover, this module will cover GraphFrames on Apache Spark and guide you in hands-on labs. <br/>
