1. Introduction to Data Engineering - [Completed]
This course introduces you to the core concepts, processes, and tools you need to know in order to get 
a foundational knowledge of data engineering. You will gain an understanding of the modern data ecosystem 
and the role Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Data Analysts play in this ecosystem. 

2. Python for Data Science, AI & Development - [Completed]
You will learn Python fundamentals, including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on 
exercises throughout the course modules, and create a final project to demonstrate your new skills. By the 
end of this course, you’ll feel comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and solving 
real-world problems in Python. You’ll gain a strong foundation for more advanced learning in the field, 
and develop skills to help advance your career. 

3. Python Project for Data Engineering - [Completed]
This mini-course is intended to apply foundational Python skills by implementing different techniques to 
collect and work with data. Assume the role of a Data Engineer and extract data from multiple file formats, 
transform it into specific datatypes, and then load it into a single source for analysis. Continue with the 
course and test your knowledge by implementing webscraping and extracting data with APIs all with the help 
of multiple hands-on labs.

4. Introduction to Relational Databases (RDBMs) - [Completed]
The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply 
foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access 
in a data science environment. The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning . As such, 
you will work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. You will create a 
database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building and running SQL 
queries. You will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

5. Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python - [Completed]
The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and foundational knowledge of the SQL 
language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment. The 
emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning. You will create a database instance in the cloud. 
Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building and running SQL queries. You will also learn how 
to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

6. Hands-on Introductino to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting - [Completed]
This mini-course provides a practical introduction to commonly used Linux / UNIX shell commands and teaches you 
basics of Bash shell scripting to automate a variety of tasks. In this course you will work with general purpose 
commands like id, date, uname, ps, top, echo, man; directory manageent commands such as pwd, cd, mkdir, rmdir, 
find, df; file management commands like cat, wget, more, head, tail, cp, mv, touch, tar, zip, unzip; access control 
command chmod; text processing commands - wc, grep, tr; as well as networking commands - hostname, ping, ifconfig 
and curl. You will create simple to more advanced shell scripts that involve Metacha-racters, Quoting, Variables, 
Command substitution, I/O Redirection, Pipes & Filters, and Command line arguments. You will also schedule cron 
jobs using crontab.

7. Relational Database Administration (DBA) - [Completed]
In this course, you will discover some of the activities, techniques, and best practices for managing a database. 
You will learn about configuring and upgrading database server software and related products. You will also learn 
about database security; how to implement user authentication, assign roles, and assign object-level permissions. 
You will also gain an understanding of how to perform backup and restore procedures in case of system failures. You 
will learn about how to optimize databases for performance, monitor databases, collect diagnostic data, and access 
error information to help you resolve issues that may occur. Many of these tasks are repetitive, so you will learn 
how to schedule maintenance activities and regular diagnostic tests and send automated messages of the success or 
failure of a task.

8. ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow and Kafka - [Completed]
