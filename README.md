1. Introduction to Data Engineering - [Completed]
This course introduces you to the core concepts, processes, and tools you need to know in order to get a foundational knowledge 
of data engineering. You will gain an understanding of the modern data ecosystem and the role Data Engineers, Data Scientists, 
and Data Analysts play in this ecosystem. 

2. Python for Data Science, AI & Development - [Completed]
You will learn Python fundamentals, including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on exercises throughout the 
course modules, and create a final project to demonstrate your new skills.

3. Python Project for Data Engineering - [Completed]
This mini-course is intended to apply foundational Python skills by implementing different techniques to collect and work with 
data. Assume the role of a Data Engineer and extract data from multiple file formats, transform it into specific datatypes, and 
then load it into a single source for analysis. Continue with the course and test your knowledge by implementing webscraping and 
extracting data with APIs all with the help of multiple hands-on labs.

4. Introduction to Relational Databases (RDBMs) - [Completed]
The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of 
the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment. The emphasis 
in this course is on hands-on and practical learning . As such, you will work with real databases, real data science tools, and 
real-world datasets. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building 
and running SQL queries. You will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

5. Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python - [Completed]
The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is 
also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment. The emphasis in this course is on 
hands-on and practical learning. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will 
practice building and running SQL queries. You will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

6. Introduction to NoSQL Databases - [In Progress]
This mini-course provides a practical introduction to commonly used Linux / UNIX shell commands and teaches you basics of Bash shell 
scripting to automate a variety of tasks. The course includes both video-based lectures as well as hands-on labs to practice and apply 
what you learn. You will have no-charge access to a virtual Linux server that you can access through your web browser, so you don't 
need to download and install anything to perform the labs. 

7. Introduction to Big Data with Spark and Hadoop

8. Data Engineering and Machine Learning using Spark

9. Hands-on Introductino to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting

10. ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow and Kafka

11. Getting Started with Data Warehousing and BI Analytics

12. Relational Database Administration (DBA)

13. Data Engineering Capstone Project
