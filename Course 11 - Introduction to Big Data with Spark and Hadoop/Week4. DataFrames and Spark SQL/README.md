# DataFrames and Spark SQL <br/>

## Description <br/>
In this module, you’ll learn about Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), their uses in Apache Spark, and RDD transformations and actions. You'll compare the use of datasets with Spark's latest data abstraction, DataFrames. You'll learn to identify and apply basic DataFrame operations. You’ll explore Apache Spark SQL optimization and learn how Spark SQL and memory optimization benefit from using Catalyst and Tungsten. Finally, you’ll fortify your skills with guided hands-on lab to create a table view and apply data aggregation techniques. <br/>

## Objectives <br/>
* Describe Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) and their uses in Apache Spark.
* Describe data set features, benefits, and creation in Apache Spark and contrast datasets with DataFrames.
* Describe how Catalyst and Tungsten benefit Spark SQL and how Spark performs SQL and memory optimization using Catalyst and Tungsten.
* Identify basic DataFrame operations and apply them, using Spark DataFrames, on real-world data.
* Load, view, manipulate, and aggregate data in a DataFrame.
* Define Spark SQL and identify supported data sources.
* Create a DataFrame table view and aggregate data in the table view.
* Create a Pandas user-defined function (UDF) to perform columnar operations.
