# Apache Spark <br/>

## Description <br/>
In this module, you’ll turn your attention to the popular Apache Spark platform, where you will explore the attributes and benefits of Apache Spark and distributed computing. You'll gain key insights about functional programming and Lambda functions. You’ll also explore Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), parallel programming, resilience in Apache Spark, and relate RDDs and parallel programming with Apache Spark. Then, you’ll dive into additional Apache Spark components and learn how Apache Spark scales with Big Data. Working with Big Data signals the need for working with queries, including structured queries using SQL. You’ll also learn about the functions, parts, and benefits of Spark SQL and DataFrame queries, and discover how DataFrames work with Spark SQL. <br/>
