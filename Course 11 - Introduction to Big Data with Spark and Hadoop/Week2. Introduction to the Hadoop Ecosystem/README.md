# Introduction to Hadoop Ecosystem <br/>

## Description <br/>
In this module, you'll gain a fundamental understanding of the Apache Hadoop architecture, ecosystem, practices, and commonly used applications, including Distributed File System (HDFS), MapReduce, Hive, and HBase. You’ll also gain practical skills in hands-on labs when you query the data added using Hive, launch a single-node Hadoop cluster using Docker, and run MapReduce jobs. <br/>

## Objectives <br/>
* Define Hadoop and review its history, including its relationship with Big Data processing and some of its challenges.
* Explain MapReduce, including its applications, components, and use cases.
* List the stages of the Hadoop ecosystem, identify some of the tools used in each stage, and differentiate between Hadoop’s core and extended components.
* Explain the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), identify its key features, and describe its architecture.
* Describe Hive’s uses, features, and architecture.
* Describe HBase and its features, uses, architecture, and concepts.
* Create a table in Hive, add data to the table, and query the data using SQL commands.
* Run a single-node Hadoop instance.
* Perform a word count by using Hadoop MapReduce.
