# Monitoring and Tuning <br/>

## Description <br/>
Platforms and applications require monitoring and tuning to manage issues that inevitably happen. In this module, you'll learn about connecting the Apache Spark user interface web server and using the same UI web server to manage application processes. You’ll also identify common Apache Spark application issues and learn about debugging issues using the application UI and locating related log files. Further, you’ll discover and gain real-world knowledge about how Spark manages memory and processor resources using the hands-on lab. <br/>

## Objectives <br/>
* Connect to the Apache Spark user interface web server and navigate the Spark user interface.
* Define parts of the Apache Spark application workflow, use UI webserver to monitor application progress, and describe a sample UI workflow.
* Identify common Apache Spark application issues, debug issues using the application UI, and locate and read related log files.
* Describe Apache Spark memory parameters, memory management, and data persistence.
* Set executor memory on submit and configure executor memory and cores for Spark Standalone.
* Explain how Apache Spark uses processor cores and how to use Spark to configure cores for an application.
* Create a DataFrame in PySpark shell and open the Spark Application web UI.
* Run an SQL query to monitor application performance, then scale up by adding another worker to the Spark Standalone cluster.
