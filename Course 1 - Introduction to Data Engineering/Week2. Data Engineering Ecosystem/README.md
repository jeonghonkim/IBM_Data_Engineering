# Data Engineering Ecosystem <br/>

## Description <br/>
In this module, you will learn about the data engineering ecosystem, the different types of data structures, file formats, sources of data, and the languages data professionals use in their day-to-day tasks. You will gain an understanding of several different types of data repositories such as relational and non-relational databases, data warehouses, data marts, and data lakes. You will learn about ETL and ELT processes, data pipelines, and data integration platforms. You will also gain an understanding of what big data is, and the tools used for processing and storing big data. During the course of this module, you will be guided to provision an instance of IBM Db2 using the Cloud Lite account you created in the previous module. <br/>

## Objectives <br/>
* Describe the elements of a data engineering ecosystem which includes data, data repositories, data integration platforms, data pipelines, languages, and BI and Reporting tools.
* Describe RDBMSes and NoSQL databases as well as examples of use.
* Explain the use of Data Integration Platforms and how they relate to data pipelines and the ETL and ELT processes.
* Summarize what big data is, how it impacts the collection, monitoring, storage, analysis, and reporting of data, and what some of the big data processing tools are.
* Explain the characteristics and use of some of the programming, querying, and scripting languages.
