# Data Engineering Lifecycle <br/>

## Description <br/>
In this module, we will walk you through the data engineering lifecycle. You will learn about the architecture of a data platform, factors for selecting and designing data stores, and the different facets of security as it applies to data platforms and data lifecycle management. You will also learn about the process, steps, and tools used for gathering, importing, wrangling, and querying data. You will gain an understanding of performance monitoring and the steps you can take to troubleshoot performance issues. We will also talk about governance regulations, why we need them, and how technology enables compliance to regulations. During the course of this module, you will be guided to load data from a CSV file into the IBM Db2 instance you created in the previous module. You will also be guided to explore your dataset using some basic SQL queries that will be provided to you. <br/>
