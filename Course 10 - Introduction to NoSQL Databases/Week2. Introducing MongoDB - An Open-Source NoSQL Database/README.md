# Introducing NoSQL <br/>

## Description <br/>
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is easy to access by indexing and supports various data types, including dates and numbers. MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL database today, empowering users to query, manipulate, and find interesting insights from their collected data. It can also be used for a variety of purposes because of the flexibility of storing structured or unstructured data. In this module, you will learn about the characteristics of MongoDB and expand your hands-on working knowledge of MongoDB performing various common tasks including create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, limit and sort records, indexing, and aggregation. You will explore replication and sharding, which are very important concepts in MongoDB. The scale and availability we see with MongoDB is achieved using these two concepts. <br/>
