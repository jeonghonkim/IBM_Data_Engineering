# Introducing NoSQL <br/>

## Description <br/>
NoSQL means Not only SQL. The term refers to a class of databases that are non-relational in architecture. They have their roots in the open source community. NoSQL databases have become more popular due to the demands of Big Data. In this module, you will learn about the characteristics of NoSQL and the four main categories of NoSQL databases available. You will explore the differences between the ACID and BASE consistency models, the advantages and challenges of distributed systems, and the CAP theorem and its characteristics. You will learn how to decide when to use RDBMS and when to use NoSQL. <br/>
