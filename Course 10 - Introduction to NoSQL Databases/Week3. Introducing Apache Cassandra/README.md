# Introducing Apache Cassandra <br/>

## Description <br/>
Apache Cassandra is an open source database. It is best used by "always available" type of applications that require a database that is always available, that scales fast in situations of high traffic, and is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Apache Cassandra is best used by online services like Netflix, Uber, and Spotify. In this module, you will learn about the characteristics of Apache Cassandra. You will also expand your hands-on working knowledge of Cassandra performing various common tasks including using the CQL shell, keyspace operations, table operations, and CRUD operations. <br/>
